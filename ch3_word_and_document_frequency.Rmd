Central Question: how to quantify what a document is about?
Term Frequency (tf) - how frequently a word occurs in a document
Inverse Document Frequency (idf) - decreases the weight for commonly used words and increases for not used very much
tf-idf is the frequency of a term adjusted for how rarely it is used

Term Frequency in Jane Austen's Novels
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(janeaustenr)
library(tidytext)

book_words <- austen_books() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  count(book, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()

total_words <- book_words %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(n))

book_words <- left_join(book_words, total_words)

book_words

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(book_words, aes(n/total, fill = book)) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend = FALSE) +
  xlim(NA, 0.0009) +
  facet_wrap(~book, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_x_log10()
```
Zipf's Law states that the ferquency that a word appears is inversely proportonal to its rank
```{r}
freq_by_rank <- book_words %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  mutate(rank = row_number(), 
         `term frequency` = n/total) 

freq_by_rank

freq_by_rank %>%
  ggplot(aes(rank, `term frequency`, color = book)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.1, alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()

#graph below shows that austen's novels are similar to each other and the rank and frequency has a negative slope
```
Looking only at the middle secton of the rank range
```{r}
rank_subset <- freq_by_rank %>%
  filter(rank < 500, rank >10)

lm(log10(`term frequency`) ~ log10(rank), data = rank_subset)

freq_by_rank %>%
  ggplot(aes(rank, `term frequency`, color = book)) +
  #calues are from lm function above
  geom_abline(intercept = -0.62, slope = -1.1, color = "gray50", linetype = 2) +
  geom_line(size = 1.1, alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
#similar graph as above but adding in the abline
#abline represents Zipf's law because of lm formula
```
The bind_tf_idf function takes a tidy text dataset as input with one row per token per doc
```{r}
book_words <- book_words %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, book, n) 
book_words
#tf_idf is very low for words that occur in many documents in a collection
book_words %>%
  select(-total) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))
#shows proper nounce that are important in their respective novels
book_words %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  mutate(word = factor(word, levels = rev(unique(word)))) %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  top_n(15) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = book)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf") +
  facet_wrap(~book, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()
```
Looking at physics texts
```{r}
library(gutenbergr)

physics <- gutenberg_download(c(37729, 14725, 13476, 5001), meta_fields = "author")
#basic word and count info
physics_words <- physics %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  count(author, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()
physics_words

#looking into tf-idf and visualizing
plot_physics <- physics_words %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, author, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  mutate(word = factor(word, levels = rev(unique(word)))) %>%
  mutate(author = factor(author, levels = c("Galilei, Galileo", "Huygens, Christiaan",
                                            "Tesla, Nikola", "Einstein, Albert")))
#plotting top tf-idf
plot_physics %>%
  group_by(author) %>%
  #top15 words based off of tf-idf
  top_n(15, tf_idf) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, tf_idf)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = author)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf") +
  facet_wrap(~author, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()

```
Making sure all the words ranked SHOULD be there
```{r}
library(stringr)

physics %>%
  filter(str_detect(text, "eq\\.")) %>%
  select(text)
#we may need to remove eq

physics %>% 
  filter(str_detect(text, "K1")) %>%
  select(text)
#we may need to keep this

physics %>%
  filter(str_detect(text, "AK")) %>%
  select(text)
```
Remove less meaningful words to make a more meaningful plot. 
Adding them to stop words, and anti_join to remove them
```{r}
mystopwords <- data_frame(word = c("eq", "co", "rc", "ac", "ak", "bn", 
                                   "fig", "file", "cg", "cb", "cm"))
physics_words <- anti_join(physics_words, mystopwords, by = "word")

plot_physics <- physics_words %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, author, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  mutate(word = factor(word, levels = rev(unique(word)))) %>%
  group_by(author) %>%
  top_n(15, tf_idf) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  mutate(author = factor(author, levels = c("Galilei, Galileo", "Huygens, Christiaan",
                                            "Tesla, Nikola", "Einstein, Albert")))

ggplot(plot_physics, aes(word, tf_idf, fill = author)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf") +
  facet_wrap(~author, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()
```
